ETFBA
=======================================

ETFBA is a Python package implementing *e*nzyme protein allocation and *t*hermodynamics constraint-based *f*lux *b*alance *a*nalysis. In addition to mass balance, ETFBA further shapes the metabolic flux based on the protein resource availability of catalyzing enzymes and the second law of thermodynamics, extending the application of traditional flux balance analysis.

The constraints of enzyme protein allocation and thermodynamics can be used seperately or jointly in the model, thus yielding various optimization problems, such as: FBA (traditional flux balance analysis), EFBA (enzyme protein allocation constraint activated), TFBA (thermodynamic constraints activated) and ETFBA (both type of constraints activated). Variability analysis can further be performed to assess the possible range of metabolic fluxes (FVA, EFVA, TFVA and ETFVA), enzyme protein costs (EVA and TEVA) and reaction Gibbs energy change (TVA and ETVA) while still achieving a certain level of optimality in the objective function.
