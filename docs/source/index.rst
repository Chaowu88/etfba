Documentation for ETFBA
===================================

ETFBA is a Python package that extends metabolic flux balance analysis (FBA) by incorporating constraints on enzyme protein allocation and thermodynamics. ETFBA is capabable of:

- Growth simulation and metabolic flux estimation
- Variability analysis of flux, enzyme allocation and reaction energetics

with the above constraints separately or together.
