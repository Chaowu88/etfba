Documentation for ETFBA
===================================

ETFBA is a Python package for metabolic flux balance analysis integrating constraints of enzyme protein allocation and thermodynamics. ETFBA is capabable of:

- Growth simulation and metabolite flux estimation
- Variability analysis of flux, enzyme protein cost and reaction Gibbs energy change

with the above constraints seperately or together.
